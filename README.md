# Number Guessing Game
A fun and challenging game where the user tries to guess a secret three-digit number generated by the computer. Can you beat the computer and win the game?

Gameplay Demo

How to Play
The computer generates a secret three-digit number with no repeating digits.
The user has a limited number of guesses to correctly guess the number.
After each guess, the computer provides feedback to help the user refine their guess:
"fermi" means that a guessed digit is in the correct position and is the correct digit.
"pico" means that a guessed digit is in the secret number, but is not in the correct position.
"bagels" means that none of the guessed digits are in the secret number.
If the user correctly guesses the number within the allotted number of guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.
Customization
The game can be customized by modifying the following variables in the code:

Num_Digit: the length of the secret number (default: 3)
N_Guesses: the number of guesses allowed (default: 10)
How to Run
To run the game, simply execute the main() function in the code. The game will prompt the user to input their guesses and provide feedback accordingly.
